# Gravity Physics Simulation

This project simulates the effects of gravity on objects in a two-dimensional space. It demonstrates basic principles of physics such as gravitational attraction, motion, and collision responses.

## Features

- Realistic gravitational pull between objects
- Object motion based on mass and distance
- Configurable simulation parameters (gravity strength, initial velocities, object mass, etc.)
- Visual representation of the simulation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

This project is built with pure (vanilla) JavaScript and does not require any libraries or frameworks.
